## What is AWS ACE?

**AWS ACE (Amazon Web Services Customer Engagement)** is a joint CRM platform between AWS partners and AWS that enables collaborative selling and pipeline management. It's part of the AWS Partner Network (APN) and serves as the primary mechanism for:

- **Co-selling with AWS Sales teams**
- **Managing joint customer opportunities**
- **Accessing AWS-generated leads and referrals**
- **Qualifying for partner incentives like POD and PGR**

### Key Benefits
- Direct alignment with AWS Sales representatives on customer opportunities
- Access to AWS technical and sales support resources
- Eligibility for AWS opportunity referrals and leads
- **Qualification for Partner Originated Discount (POD) and Partner Growth Rebate (PGR)**
- Enhanced visibility with AWS and customers

## How ACE Enables POD and PGR Incentives

### Partner Originated Discount (POD) - Primary Focus
**POD recognizes AWS Solution Providers for originating and winning new end-customer opportunities and developing early-stage AWS customers.**

#### Critical POD Requirements

**1. Submit Partner Originated Opportunity through ACE:**
- Submit opportunity through the APN Customer Engagements (ACE) Program for validation
- Must be **partner-originated** (not AWS-generated leads)
- Customer consent required before submission

**2. Launch with Accurate Target Close Date and AWS Account ID:**
- **Target Close Date must not be in the past**
- **AWS Account ID must have less than $5,000 USD billed revenue the month prior to the Target Close Date**
- Opportunity must progress to **"Launched" stage** when billing begins

**3. Complete End User Reporting (EUR):**
- **Usage Type must equal 'End User'**
- **Government fields must be completed**
- **Accounts where 'Government Advising = Yes?' will NOT qualify**
- Ensure all reported information is accurate

#### POD Benefit Details
- **Duration:** 24 months provided you continue to meet all EUR and Channel Program requirements
- **Start Date:** POD begins the 1st of the month following your Target Close Date
- **Example:** Opportunity launched with Target Close Date of Feb 1st, 2022 â†’ POD starts March 1st, 2022
- **Stability:** Changes to ACE Opportunity after POD begins (e.g., stage changes) will not impact your discount

#### Early-Stage Customer Qualification
**The $5,000 USD threshold is the key qualifier:**
- AWS Account ID must have **less than $5,000 USD billed revenue** in the month **prior** to the Target Close Date
- This ensures the customer is truly early-stage in their AWS journey
- Multiple AWS Account IDs per opportunity are not supported - submit separate opportunities for each account

### Partner Growth Rebate (PGR) - Reference Only
**PGR recognizes AWS Solution Providers for growing existing AWS Program Accounts.**

**Note:** While PGR is valuable, this document focuses primarily on POD optimization. PGR requirements include quarterly growth targets measured against existing customer accounts with rebates paid in AWS Promotional Credits.

2. **Additional Information:** May require clarification or additional details
3. **Approval:** Validated opportunities receive "Approved" status
4. **AWS Contact Assignment:** Approved opportunities get assigned AWS Sales contacts

## Opportunity Stages and Management

### AWS Sales Stages
| Stage | Description | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Prospect** | Customer opportunity identified | Initial customer contact |
| **Qualified** | Customer engaged, requirements understood | Customer confirms real interest |
| **Technical Validation** | Solution technically validated | Proof of concept, architecture sessions |
| **Business Validation** | Financial viability confirmed | Business stakeholder buy-in |
| **Committed** | Customer commits to solution | Technology, architecture, economics agreed |
| **Launched** | Billing has begun | **Critical for POD eligibility** |
| **Closed Lost** | Customer selected different option | Document reasons |

### Critical Update Requirements
**For POD Qualification:**
1. **Regular Updates:** Update opportunities at least every 2 weeks
2. **Stage Progression:** Accurately reflect current opportunity stage
3. **Target Close Date:** Keep dates realistic and updated
4. **Spend Estimates:** Ensure AWS MRR estimates are accurate
5. **Launch Confirmation:** Must update to "Launched" when customer billing begins

## POD Optimization Strategies

### Pre-Opportunity Assessment
1. **Customer Spend Verification**
   - **Critical:** Confirm AWS Account ID has less than $5,000 USD billed revenue in the month prior to Target Close Date
   - **Timing:** Validate spend before setting Target Close Date
   - **Documentation:** Capture current spend levels for validation

2. **End User Reporting Preparation**
   - **Usage Type:** Must be set to 'End User' 
   - **Government Flag:** Ensure 'Government Advising' is set to 'No' (accounts with 'Yes' are disqualified)
   - **Accuracy:** All government fields must be completed accurately

### ACE & EUR Integration Optimization
1. **AWS Account ID Early Addition**
   - **Best Practice:** Add AWS Account ID to ACE Opportunity as early as possible
   - **Benefit:** Enables automatic sync between ACE Opportunity and End User Record (EUR)
   - **Requirement:** AWS Account ID match between ACE and EUR under your Partner ID

2. **Data Completeness**
   - **City Field:** Complete the 'City' field in ACE Opportunity to increase EUR auto-completion success
   - **Bulk Operations:** Use ACE Bulk Import tool for multiple opportunity submissions
   - **Regular Monitoring:** Check End User Reporting regularly to ensure data accuracy

### Launch Requirements
1. **Target Close Date Management**
   - **Requirement:** Target Close Date cannot be in the past
   - **Critical Window:** AWS Account must have <$5K spend in month prior to this date
   - **Launch Timing:** Update opportunity to "Launched" when customer billing actually begins

2. **POD Disqualification Prevention**
   - **Government Accounts:** Any account with 'Government Advising = Yes' will not qualify
   - **Multiple Accounts:** Submit separate ACE opportunities for each AWS Account ID (multiple IDs per opportunity not supported)
   - **Spend Monitoring:** Verify customer spend remains under $5K threshold before Target Close Date

## Technical Implementation

### CRM Integration
**AWS Partner CRM Connector** (Salesforce):
- Bidirectional sync between Salesforce and ACE Pipeline Manager
- Automated opportunity updates
- Reduced manual data entry
- Real-time visibility for sales teams

### API Access
**AWS Partner Central API:**
- Programmatic access to opportunity data
- Bulk operations support
- Integration with internal systems
- Automated reporting capabilities

### Required Permissions
**For CRM Integration:**
- AWS account linked to Partner Central
- IAM roles and policies configured
- Salesforce Lightning Experience (Enterprise/Professional/Unlimited)

## Common POD Disqualification Issues

### Spend Threshold Violations
**Problem:** Customer exceeds $5,000 USD spend limit
**Solutions:**
- **Monitor monthly:** Track customer AWS spend before setting Target Close Date
- **Timing adjustment:** Adjust Target Close Date if customer spend increases unexpectedly
- **Account verification:** Confirm correct AWS Account ID is being tracked

### End User Reporting Errors
**Problem:** EUR data disqualifies opportunity
**Solutions:**
- **Usage Type:** Ensure Usage Type is set to 'End User' (not reseller or other types)
- **Government Flag:** Set 'Government Advising = No' (Yes will disqualify)
- **Data completeness:** Complete all required government fields accurately

### Target Close Date Issues
**Problem:** Target Close Date errors causing disqualification
**Solutions:**
- **Future dates only:** Never set Target Close Date in the past
- **Spend window alignment:** Ensure <$5K spend in month prior to Target Close Date
- **Launch timing:** Update to "Launched" only when billing actually begins

### ACE & EUR Integration Failures
**Problem:** Automatic sync between ACE and EUR not working
**Solutions:**
- **Early AWS Account ID:** Add AWS Account ID to ACE Opportunity immediately
- **Complete City field:** Fill in City field to improve auto-completion success
- **Manual verification:** Regularly check EUR data accuracy even with integration

### Multiple Account Complications
**Problem:** Customer has multiple AWS accounts
**Solutions:**
- **Separate opportunities:** Submit individual ACE opportunities for each AWS Account ID
- **Clear project descriptions:** Ensure each opportunity meets ACE validation criteria independently
- **Spend verification:** Verify each account individually meets <$5K threshold
