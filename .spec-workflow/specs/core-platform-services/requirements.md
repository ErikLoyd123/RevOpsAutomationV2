# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Core Platform Services specification defines the advanced application layer that builds upon the database infrastructure foundation. This phase implements FastAPI microservices, BGE-M3 GPU-accelerated semantic matching, configurable rules engine for POD (Partner Originated Discount) automation, and a React frontend for testing and monitoring. The platform provides the complete application stack needed to automate POD opportunity identification and matching while maintaining extensibility for multiple customers and partner programs.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This platform directly supports Cloud303's goal of automating POD opportunity identification by:
- Implementing FastAPI microservices for scalable data processing and business logic
- Providing GPU-accelerated BGE-M3 embeddings for semantic similarity matching between opportunities
- Creating a configurable rules engine that can adapt to different partner programs and business requirements
- Building a React frontend interface for testing, monitoring, and managing the automation workflow
- Establishing patterns that can extend to multiple customers and different partner ecosystems (Microsoft CSP, Google Cloud Partner, etc.)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: FastAPI Microservices Architecture

2. IF a service fails THEN other services SHALL continue operating independently without cascading failures
3. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use REST APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
4. IF load increases THEN individual services SHALL be scalable independently based on demand
5. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL include health check endpoints returning service status and dependencies

### Requirement 2: BGE-M3 GPU Embeddings Service

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want GPU-accelerated BGE-M3 embeddings generation, so that I can perform fast semantic similarity matching between company names and opportunity descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the BGE service starts THEN it SHALL utilize NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU resources for model inference
2. IF GPU is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to CPU processing with performance warnings
3. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the service SHALL support both identity embeddings (company names) and context embeddings (descriptions)
4. IF embedding generation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and log detailed error information
5. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN they SHALL be stored in the SEARCH schema with proper HNSW indexing for similarity queries
6. WHEN processing batches THEN the system SHALL optimize for RTX 3070 Ti memory constraints and processing capabilities

### Requirement 3: Opportunity Matching Service

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want automated matching between Odoo CRM opportunities and AWS ACE opportunities, so that I can identify potential POD candidates without manual comparison.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN matching is triggered THEN the system SHALL generate similarity scores using BGE embeddings and fuzzy text matching
2. IF multiple matches are found THEN the system SHALL rank them by confidence score and present top candidates
3. WHEN confidence scores are below threshold THEN matches SHALL be flagged for manual review
4. IF no suitable matches are found THEN the system SHALL log the unmatchable opportunity for analysis
5. WHEN matches are completed THEN results SHALL be stored with full audit trail and explanation of matching logic

### Requirement 4: Billing Data Normalization Service

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want normalized billing data from RAW schema, so that I can analyze customer AWS costs and validate spend thresholds for POD eligibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN billing normalization runs THEN it SHALL transform RAW billing tables (c_billing_internal_cur, c_billing_bill_line) into normalized cost entities
2. IF billing data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL flag missing data and continue processing available records
3. WHEN cost analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL provide customer spend summaries by account, service, and time period
4. IF spend thresholds are validated THEN the system SHALL use normalized billing data to determine POD eligibility
5. WHEN billing data changes THEN normalized tables SHALL be updated incrementally to maintain current cost information

### Requirement 5: POD Rules Engine

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want a configurable rules engine for POD eligibility, so that I can ensure all opportunities meet partner program requirements and business policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rules are evaluated THEN the system SHALL check partner-originated status, spend thresholds using normalized billing data, and timeline requirements
2. IF rules configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload rules without service restart
3. WHEN opportunities fail rules THEN the system SHALL provide detailed explanations for each failed criterion
4. IF spend validation is required THEN the system SHALL query normalized billing data to verify customer AWS usage patterns
5. WHEN rules pass THEN opportunities SHALL be marked as POD-eligible with approval workflow triggers

### Requirement 6: React Frontend Interface

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want a web interface for monitoring and testing the automation platform, so that I can oversee POD matching workflows and investigate any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the interface THEN users SHALL see a dashboard with system status, recent matches, and performance metrics
2. IF authentication is required THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing authentication mechanisms
3. WHEN reviewing matches THEN users SHALL see detailed similarity scores, rule evaluations, and audit trails
4. IF manual intervention is needed THEN users SHALL be able to approve, reject, or modify automated decisions
5. WHEN testing scenarios THEN users SHALL be able to trigger matching workflows and view real-time results
6. WHEN analyzing costs THEN users SHALL see normalized billing data visualizations and spend threshold validations

### Requirement 7: Service Orchestration and Integration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want proper service orchestration and integration patterns, so that all microservices work together reliably in a production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL register with service discovery and wait for dependencies to be ready
2. IF external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures
3. WHEN data flows between services THEN message queues SHALL ensure reliable delivery and processing order
4. IF transactions span multiple services THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and rollback mechanisms
5. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN all services SHALL emit metrics, logs, and distributed tracing information

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Environment Management

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want externalized configuration management, so that I can deploy the same services across different environments with environment-specific settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL load configuration from environment variables and external configuration files
2. IF configuration is missing THEN services SHALL fail fast with clear error messages indicating required settings
3. WHEN sensitive information is needed THEN it SHALL be loaded from secure secret management systems
4. IF configuration changes THEN services SHALL support hot-reload where possible without downtime
5. WHEN deploying THEN different environments SHALL use separate configuration namespaces to prevent cross-environment issues

### Requirement 9: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality engineer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities, so that I can ensure system reliability and catch regressions before they impact production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is developed THEN it SHALL include unit tests with minimum 80% code coverage
2. IF services interact THEN integration tests SHALL verify API contracts and data flow between services
3. WHEN end-to-end testing THEN automated tests SHALL verify complete workflows from data ingestion to final POD decisions
