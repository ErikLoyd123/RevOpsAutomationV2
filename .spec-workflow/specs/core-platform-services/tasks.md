- [ ] Research cross-encoder models for reranking
- [ ] Implement cross-encoder integration for top matches
- [ ] Create A/B testing framework for reranking comparison
- [ ] Benchmark performance impact vs. quality improvement
- **Status**: Deferred - Current semantic + company matching showing excellent results
- **Prerequisites**: 4.7 (baseline results), research on cross-encoder performance
- **Priority**: Low - Enhancement for future consideration

### Task 4.9: Temporal Reranking Enhancement üìã
- [ ] **Enhance existing matching script** (`scripts/03-data/20_initial_opportunity_matching.py`) with temporal reranking
- [ ] **Fix Data Pipeline**: Update APN data extraction to properly capture `created_date` field
- [ ] **Preserve Core Algorithm**: Keep proven CSV+ formula `40% context + 30% identity + 30% company_fuzzy`
- [ ] **Add Temporal Reranking**: Apply temporal multiplier to refine existing scores
- [ ] **Temporal Multiplier Logic**:
  - Same month: 1.10x boost (10% increase)
  - 3 months: 1.05x boost (5% increase)  
  - 6 months: 1.00x neutral (no change)
  - 12 months: 0.95x penalty (5% decrease)
  - 18+ months: 0.85x penalty (15% decrease)
- [ ] **Implementation**: `final_score = csv_plus_score * temporal_multiplier`
- [ ] **Configuration**: Add temporal boost/penalty parameters as script config options
- [ ] **Quality Analysis**: Compare temporal-enhanced results vs current CSV+ baseline
- [ ] **Business Validation**: Measure impact on high-confidence matches and manual review reduction

**Implementation Approach**: 
- **Preserve Company Focus**: Keep 60% company-focused weighting (30% identity + 30% fuzzy)
- **Temporal as Refinement**: Apply temporal multiplier to existing scores, not as separate component
- **Single Script Enhancement**: Maintain existing `csv_plus_match_single_opportunity()` function
- **Backward Compatible**: Temporal enhancement optional, defaults to neutral (1.0x)

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add temporal date extraction to opportunity loading
2. Create temporal multiplier calculation function
3. Apply multiplier to `overall_scores` after CSV+ calculation  
4. Add temporal analysis to results reporting

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/03-data/20_initial_opportunity_matching.py` (main enhancement)
- `scripts/03-data/07_extract_apn_data.py` (fix created_date extraction)

**Prerequisites**: 4.4 (current matching working), APN created_date field extraction fix
