"""
AWS Discount Data Normalization Script for RevOps Automation Platform.

This script merges and normalizes discount data from SPP (Solution Provider Program)
and Ingram distributor billing sources into a unified core.aws_discounts table.

Key Features:
- Merges raw.odoo_c_billing_spp_bill and raw.odoo_c_billing_ingram_bill
- Transforms SPP discount rows to columns to match Ingram format
- Resolves customer names and account information from aws_accounts
- Maps discount types consistently between both sources

Data Sources:
- raw.odoo_c_billing_spp_bill: 6,148 records (SPP discount data)
- raw.odoo_c_billing_ingram_bill: 101,392 records (Ingram discount data)

Target: core.aws_discounts (unified discount table)

Usage:
    # Full discount normalization
    python 15_normalize_discount_data.py --full-normalize
    
    # Normalize only SPP data
    python 15_normalize_discount_data.py --source spp
    
    # Normalize only Ingram data
    python 15_normalize_discount_data.py --source ingram
    
    # Check normalization status
    python 15_normalize_discount_data.py --status

Dependencies:
- Task 3.1 (billing table creation) ‚úÖ
- Task 4.3 (Odoo data extraction) ‚úÖ
- Raw discount data in raw.odoo_c_billing_spp_bill and raw.odoo_c_billing_ingram_bill
- core.aws_accounts table for customer name resolution
